# DotFive LightDM Greeter

Default LightDM greeter for dotfive written in Vala.

# Errors

  * First run - error org.freedesktop.ConsoleKit was not found in any .service files - apt-get install consolekit
  * error org.freedesktop.AccountService was not found in any .service files - apt-get install accountsservice

# Notes

 * `Log.set_default_handler (log_cb);` is required so it doesn't use the default logger which requires environment variables to be set and logs output strangely in a way lightdm doesn't capture it

# TODO

  * Check for existence of known bugs
