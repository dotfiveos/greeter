# DotFive LightDM Greeter

Default LightDM greeter for dotfive written in Vala.

# Errors

  * First run - error org.freedesktop.ConsoleKit was not found in any .service files - apt-get install consolekit
  * error org.freedesktop.AccountService was not found in any .service files - apt-get install accountsservice

# Notes

 * `Log.set_default_handler (log_cb);` is required so it doesn't use the default logger which requires environment variables to be set and logs output strangely in a way lightdm doesn't capture it
 * At the moment custom vapi files are required for javascriptcure because the bundled verison for Vala doesn't contain a Context
 * VAPI files are required for webkitgtk as well because otherwise you need to mix `webkit2gtk-4.0` and `webkit2gtk-web-extention-4.0` (for bi-directional javascript) which currently isn't supported

# TODO

  * Check for existence of known bugs 
    * https://stackoverflow.com/questions/43499146/gtk-3-window-freezes-when-webkit2-is-used-vala
  * Figure out what to do to use the `webkit2gtk-4.0`, `webkit2gtk-web-extention-4.0` and `javascriptcoregtl-4.0` instead of custom VAPIs
